# gameSauceNative

## Description
This application is built using the React Native framework to be an iOS native application. GameSauce is a project that I made that uses the NHL's API to pull in game data, extract the necessary data I need with code logic, and displays real time statistic information of all of the current day's games. This application uses all of the same API logic to get the NHL's game data, but is built using a more refined for mobile UX design, and does not feature a back end or data base for creating and storing user accounts. 

User Story: As a user I want to be able to view NHL game statistics on a clean, easy to use interface.

## Usage
This application is currently under development and is not an open to the public for contribution at this time. Feel free to view the code base as much as you would like, but this is currently a strictly a personal project.
